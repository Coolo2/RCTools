# RCTools
 
A website containing several tools for RulerCraft.

https://rctools.coolo2.repl.co/

## The Tools

### Time

*A RulerCraft-specific calendar so that anyone from any IRL timezone can reference the same in-game times! You can convert between IRL time and RC time easily and share times with others!*

### Map

*A map of nations' wanted claims and potentially contested regions. Updated regularly by nation leaders* 

### RulerHelper

*A Discord bot for your nation servers to provide useful statistics and access a huge amount of information from the comfort of Discord!*

The bot's source code can be found on [its github repo](https://github.com/Coolo22/RulerHelper)        

### Time Machine

*The RulerCraft map through time. Updates fully every day and partially every hour*

The Time Machine renders the dynmap at regular intervals so you can look through the history of the server through time. 

## Note

RCTools development has been discontinued. The [website](https://rctools.coolo2.repl.co/) will remain up however the Time Machine will be disabled in the future due to running costs.
